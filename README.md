## Projects
**Marketing Campaign Data Analysis and Visualization** | [Project_Link1](https://github.com/Su-Jung-Choi/marketing_campaign)
- Utilized MS Excel to clean and preprocess Maven marketing data for 2,240 customers, conducting in-depth analysis using PivotTables and charts to explore key metrics, including customer demographics and product preferences.
- Analyzed marketing campaign effectiveness, revealing that the latest campaign achieved the highest conversion rate at 14.91% and identified a significant retention issue, with 70% of customers not making a purchase in over 30 days.
- Delivered a comprehensive data analysis report using Tableau Story, presenting key findings and actionable recommendations such as targeted marketing for Gen X customers, enhancing in-store and online experiences, and strategies to improve customer retention and website engagement to boost sales and satisfaction.

**Research Paper Classification: A Neural Network Approach with Feature Selection and TF-IDF** | [Project_Link2](https://github.com/Su-Jung-Choi/text_classification)
- Preprocessed an initial dataset of 20,972 papers to address class imbalance, resulting in a balanced dataset of 6,544 papers with titles and abstracts across four subject fields.
- Developed a custom implementation to generate TF-IDF vectors for text representation and utilized feature selection techniques (mutual information, chi-square test, and ANOVA F-value) to reduce the number of features from 27,490 unique terms to an optimal subset of 10,000.
- Trained a feedforward neural network model for classification, achieving a classification accuracy of 77.78% and a precision of 81% on the test set.

**Bank of America Consumer Complaints Data Analysis and Visualizations** | [Project_Link3](https://github.com/Su-Jung-Choi/consumer_complaints_project)
- Analyzed Bank of America consumer complaints data consisting of 62,516 entries using MySQL to uncover patterns, peak periods, and products, along with the corresponding issues that received the most complaints.
- Identified the bank’s response timeliness, exposing a significant 10% increase in late responses in 2021 compared to the previous year, and projecting a potential lack of improvement in 2023.
- Designed and implemented Tableau dashboards, including dynamic time series and geographical distribution, to visualize the key findings from the analysis.

**Pizza Restaurant Sales Data Analysis and Visualizations** | [Project_Link4](https://github.com/Su-Jung-Choi/restaurant_sales_analysis)
-  Created SQL views by joining and integrating data from multiple CSV files to analyze a year’s worth of pizza restaurant sales data, containing 49,574 orders.
- Extracted date information to discover peak hours, peak days, and monthly trends in sales, while also identifying bestselling and least-sold pizzas, providing insights for effective inventory management and targeted marketing strategies.
- Designed and developed interactive Tableau dashboards that includes KPIs, showcasing total sales and quantity metrics, along with additional insights derived from the data analysis.

**Traffic Accident Duration Prediction** | [Project_Link5](https://github.com/Su-Jung-Choi/big_data_project)
-  Analyzed the US accidents dataset encompassing 7.7 million entries, identifying key features for predicting accident duration.
- Optimized data readiness through adept application of preprocessing and feature engineering methodologies that include creating new features, extracting pertinent insights from existing data, and proficiently managing missing values and outliers, ensuring data integrity and enhancing analytical outcomes.
- Implemented and evaluated three regression models, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT), revealing the GBT model as the top performer with an MAE of 20.86 minutes and RMSE of 31.94 minutes.

**Movie Recommender Systems** | [Project_Link6](https://github.com/Su-Jung-Choi/movie_recommendation)
- Leveraged data preprocessing techniques on the GroupLens dataset, containing 100,836 user ratings across 9,742 movies.
- Built movie recommendation systems utilizing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and the Apriori algorithms.
- Achieved an efficient balance of speed and accuracy, with KNN displaying the quickest average runtime at under six seconds while maintaining consistent recommendation precision across all three models.

**Exam Proctoring System Using Face Detection** | [Project_Link7](https://github.com/Su-Jung-Choi/exam_proctoring_system)
-  Collected facial landmarks datasets consisting of 2,000 samples for each class, representing instances of a person looking right, front, and left.
- Trained a Neural Network model on the collected dataset and achieved an outstanding classification accuracy rate of 99.67% on the testing dataset.
- Implemented an exam proctoring system utilizing a face detection technique, which records the number of times a student looks left or right, along with the duration and timestamp of each gaze.
